								<p>This personal project was done when I was in high school in the manufacturing class room of my school. Using CorelDraw, I learned to import images into the program and convert them into vectors. Then I manipulated the vectors based on how small a support piece of metal could be without breaking apart when it was cut with the CNC Machine. I had to problem solve and transform each design so that they could be recreated using metal and empty space. This meant that I had to visualize the minimal amount of metal needed to create a design. I experimented with the free space in my designs to create shapes when creating these nameplates. </p>
								<p>After creating the designs, I uploaded them into the CNC machine software and programmed it to cut out the different designs I had. After, I used the hand grinder to smooth the surface of the nameplate. This eliminated any imperfections that occurred when the metal was cut and gave it a shiny surface. </p>
								<p>The original plan was to create a hanging mobile with these different pieces but I decided to keep the pieces separate so that my cousins would be able to keep their piece. Finally, all the nameplates were sent to be powder coated with different colours. </p>
								<p>The images below have been sent to me by my family members in India, therefore the quality of some of the images may not be as clear as others. </p>

											<figcaption><em>This is a good example of being cautious about the minimum amount of width the metal must have when being cut by the CNC Machine. In the original drawing, the dancer had her fingers spread out. This would cause problems when the metal is bring cut and polished (e.g. metal melting or breaking) so the fingers became an outline of a hand to solve this problem. </em></figcaption>
