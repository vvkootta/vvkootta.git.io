								<p>For my first year at University, I did a work-study referral to make money and gain skills on top of my academics. I am currently working with a physics professor and assisting them by doing tasks that they assign me. These tasks allow them to create their apparatus for the Rydberg atom interferometry experiment. These tasks exposed me to different areas of construction and design. </p>
								<p><strong>1. I designed a bracket that would be used to hold two rails together or move mirrors for the experiment. </strong> <br/>I designed the bracket based on the dimensions of the rail. I did this by measuring the dimensions of the rail. Then, I created the design on SolidWorks and altered the bracket if any errors were found within the design. </p>

								<p align="left"><strong>2. Given material and a schematic for a bracket, I had to recreate the bracket using various machines and tools. </strong> <br/>To do this, I first looked at the schematic for the metal bracket and understood how the bracket looked. I was able to do this by utilising SolidWorks to my advantage and viewing the bracket as a 3D piece instead of only relying on the schematic. After this step, I marked the different dimensions on the metal material and used various tools/machines within the machine shop to create the 2 brackets. The machines that I used were the vertical drill press, the milling machine, and the metal sanding belt. </p>

Created a hanging shelf using metal extrusions, acrylic, and PLA.</strong> <br/>Given multiple extrusion rods, I was tasked with creating a hanging shelf to store lab research. I measured and dimensioned the extrusions so that each unit would hold 8 shelves. The dimensions accounted for the width of the extrusion and the width of the acrylic. I created DXFs of the shelves and got them laser cut. PLA inserts were 3D printed and placed in the divets of the extrusion. Screws were put in the PLA inserts and this allowed the shelves to be attached to the extrusions.</p>

I designed and 3D printed a barrier that would keep an air tight seal while allowing exhaust to travel into the fume hood. In order to reduce the cost of materials, acrylic was used. Acrylic made up the base while ABS made up the frame. A sealant tape was used to reduce the chances of air escaping the fume hood.</p>
